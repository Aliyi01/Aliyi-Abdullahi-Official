Ethiopia’s digital transformation is advancing rapidly across multiple sectors—and here’s a clear snapshot of where it stands as of mid‑2025:


<hr>

🌐 1. Internet & Connectivity

Massive user growth: Internet users surged from ~17 million in early 2020 to over 42 million by late 2024, and roughly 44 million today  .

Mobile expansion: There are now 80.5 million mobile subscribers, and 45 million broadband users  .

Network coverage: 4G now covers ~34.8% of the country, and 5G has launched in at least 14 towns  .

🏛️ 2. Strategy & Governance

Under the “Digital Ethiopia 2025” initiative launched in mid‑2020, the government has digitized more than 130 services across 25+ institutions and built eight hundred e‑government services  .

A Digital Transformation Council monitors implementation and paves the way for the next phase, Digital Ethiopia 2030  .

🆔 3. National ID

The “Fayda ID” digital biometric system, rooted in the strategy, is being rolled out nationwide  .

This robust digital ID program supports secure eKYC processes and aims to cover all residents.

💸 4. Digital Finance

Telebirr, Ethiopia’s mobile money platform launched in 2021, boasts over 51–52 million users, driving transactions worth hundreds of billions of birr  .

Entry of Safaricom’s M‑Pesa (with 3.1 million users by January 2024) and a growing fintech regulatory framework further solidify this momentum  .

🏢 5. Infrastructure & Liberalization

Infrastructure upgrades include major data center build-outs like Raxio (Tier‑III) and new ICT parks  .

Telecom market transformed—with Safaricom’s entry as the first private operator in 2022 and plans underway for a third license by end‑2025/early‑2026  .



<hr>

👩‍💻 6. Digital Skills & Inclusion

The government’s “5 Million Ethiopian Coders” initiative aims to build a digital talent pool. As of mid‑2024, ~157,000 youths had enrolled  .

However, digital literacy remains low, especially in rural areas, which also face electricity and access challenges  .



<hr>

👨‍💻 7. Public Sector Apps & Civic Tech

The police launched an EFP Citizen Engagement App for reporting crimes via video, voice, photos—a move toward digital public services  .

The Ministry of Agriculture released a strategy for digital farming, implementing soil mapping and crop monitoring programs  .



<hr>

🔗 8. Remaining Gaps & Challenges

Digital divide persists: Just ~35% internet penetration, skewed toward urban centers  . Electricity and connectivity constraints persist in rural areas.

Digital literacy must be dramatically scaled up to ensure widespread benefit.

Cybersecurity, data privacy, and regulatory frameworks are being strengthened—but need continuous attention  .
