🗣️ Community & Criticism

User feedback:

> “It’s a six week unaccredited course… Canada employs ~100k software engineers”  
“Program offers three courses… conducted over the Internet”  



Some argue the 5 million target is overly ambitious for such a short, free program.

✅ In summary

“Ethiocoders” is Ethiopia’s massive digital upskilling project—training 5 million young citizens in coding and data skills by 2026. It’s achieved significant early traction (hundreds of thousands registered) and aligns with national goals of tech-enabled development, while sparking debate on its feasibility and depth.
